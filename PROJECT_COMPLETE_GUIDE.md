## Project Overview

**Multiplayer Plants vs. Zombies** is a real-time, browser-based multiplayer version of the classic tower defense game. Two players compete on parallel lanes against synchronized zombie waves.

### Game Modes (MVP)
- **PvP Mode**: Two players compete on parallel lanes with shared wave progression

### Core MVP Features
- ✅ Real-time synchronization (15 ticks/second)
- ✅ Server-authoritative game logic (all moves validated server-side)
- ✅ One plant type (Peashooter) and one zombie type at launch
- ✅ Room-code based session joining (share link to play)
- ✅ Win/loss detection when lawn is breached
- ✅ 30-second reconnection grace period for dropped connections
- ✅ Persistent match history

### Out of Scope (Post-MVP)
- User accounts/login or persistent player profiles
- Skill-based matchmaking
- Co-op mode
- Multiple plant/zombie types
- Sun economy (advanced features)

## What's Completed

### ✅ Infrastructure & Setup
- [x] GitHub repository created and organized
- [x] Folder structure fully set up (frontend, backend, docs)
- [x] Environment configuration templates (.env.example files)
- [x] Git configured and pushed to GitHub

### ✅ Backend (LIVE on Render)
- [x] Express.js server initialized
- [x] Socket.io integration complete
- [x] Game loop implemented (tick rate configurable via `TICK_RATE` env, default 15/s)
- [x] Room management system (single zombie per room, no wave progression yet)
- [x] Player connection handling
- [x] Plant placement validation (sun check + tile-occupied check; peashooter only)
- [x] Sun economy tracking (passive accrual only, no sunflower production yet)
- [x] Health check endpoint (`/api/health`) — verified live and responding
- [x] Statistics endpoint (`/api/stats`)
- [x] TypeScript configuration
- [x] Deployed and tested ✅
- [ ] **Match state persistence — NOT implemented.** `@supabase/supabase-js` and `@upstash/redis` are installed as dependencies but `backend/src/index.ts` never imports or calls either. All room state is in-memory only and lost on server restart.
- [ ] **Disconnect handling — NOT implemented.** There is no 30-second grace period; a disconnect immediately removes the player, and the room is deleted once empty. No `opponent_disconnected` event is sent.
- [ ] Plant damage to zombies (zombies currently take no damage and can't be killed)
- [ ] Zombie waves / multiple zombie types

**Backend URL:** https://pvz-backend-otiq.onrender.com

### 🟡 Database & Services
- [ ] Supabase/Upstash integration — accounts exist and credentials are configured in Render env vars, but no backend code uses them yet. Room/player/match state is not persisted anywhere; a server restart wipes all active games.

### ✅ Documentation
- [x] Complete technical proposal (FINAL_PROPOSAL.md)
- [x] Repository structure guide (REPO_STRUCTURE.md)
- [x] Networking contract (NETWORKING_CONTRACT_REVISED.md)
- [x] Setup instructions (GETTING_STARTED.md)
- [x] Critical evaluation of approaches (Critical_Evaluation.md)
- [x] This complete guide (PROJECT_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md)

## Current Status

### 🟢 Live Services
- ✅ **Backend Server**: Running on Render
  - Status: Live (verified `/api/health` responding July 12, 2026)
  - URL: https://pvz-backend-otiq.onrender.com
  - Health check: ✅ Responding
  - Game loop: ✅ Running (in-memory state only, no persistence)

- ⏳ **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL
  - Status: Account/credentials configured, **not wired into backend code**
  - Nothing currently reads or writes to it

- ⏳ **Cache**: Upstash Redis
  - Status: Account/credentials configured, **not wired into backend code**

- ✅ **Deployment Pipeline**: GitHub → Render
  - Auto-deploy: Enabled
  - Branch: main
  - Trigger: Push to GitHub

- ✅ **Frontend**: Deployed to Vercel at https://pvz-frontend.vercel.app/

### 🟡 In Progress
- 📍 **Frontend**: Further along than previously documented
  - Folder structure: ✅ Ready
  - TypeScript config: ✅ Done (`vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`)
  - React entry point (`main.tsx`/`App.tsx`): ✅ Built
  - Socket.io connection (`network.js`): ✅ Built, live-tested against backend
  - LobbyScene: ✅ Built (basic "waiting for room" screen)
  - GameScene: ✅ Built — renders towers/zombies from server state, click-to-place peashooter, demo mode for offline testing
  - Plant type selection UI: ⏳ Not built (only peashooter can be placed)
  - Zombie waves / combat: ⏳ Not built (backend has no combat system yet either)
  - Reconnect / opponent-disconnected UI: ⏳ Not built (backend doesn't send this event yet)

- 📍 A stray duplicate entry point (`frontend/src/main.js`, a vanilla-JS
  reimplementation of `App.tsx`) and its `styles.css` have been removed — they
  were dead code left over from an earlier approach and not referenced by
  `index.html`.

---

## Next Steps

The frontend scaffolding work originally scoped for "Week 1" is done. The real
gaps are game-logic depth and reliability features that exist on both the
backend and the docs as aspirations but not code:

### Immediate: Reconcile docs with reality
1. Backend claims persistence and reconnect handling that don't exist in code —
   either build them or stop claiming they're done (see `NETWORKING_CONTRACT_REVISED.md`
   for the full gap list).

### Next: Core gameplay
1. Implement zombie waves (currently one static zombie per room, never respawns)
2. Implement plant → zombie combat (zombies currently take no damage)
3. Add plant type selection (sunflower, wall-nut) in UI + `place_plant` payload
4. Add structured error feedback for failed placements (currently silently dropped)

### Then: Reliability
1. Add the 30-second reconnect grace period + `opponent_disconnected` messaging
2. Wire up Supabase for match persistence, or drop it from the stack if not needed for MVP
3. Interpolate zombie movement between ticks for smoother rendering

### Then: Polish & Launch
1. UI/UX pass on the live frontend (see UI/UX Review section below)
2. Bug fixes and playtesting with real players
3. Launch! 🚀

---

## Networking Contract

The frontend and backend communicate via Socket.io events. Here's the contract both must follow:

### Client → Server

#### `join_room`
Player enters a room to start/join a match.
```json
{
  "roomId": "abc123",
  "playerName": "Benny"
}
```

#### `place_plant` (as implemented — no `plant` type field yet, always peashooter)
```json
{
  "roomId": "abc123",
  "playerId": "session-a1b2c3",
  "x": 240,
  "y": 180
}
```

### Server → Client (as implemented)

#### `room_joined`
Both players are ready - game starts. (Original design called this `match_found`; it was never built that way.)
```json
{
  "roomId": "abc123",
  "playerId": "session-a1b2c3",
  "opponentId": "session-d4e5f6"
}
```

#### `state_update` (at `TICK_RATE`, default 15x/second)
Current game state - **only source of render truth**. (Original design called this `game_tick` with plants keyed by player and a wave counter; the actual shape is flatter.)
```json
{
  "tick": 482,
  "towers": [
    { "id": "t-1", "x": 240, "y": 180, "type": "peashooter", "owner": "session-a1b2c3", "hp": 100 }
  ],
  "zombies": [
    { "id": "z-1", "x": 620, "y": 180, "hp": 20 }
  ],
  "sun": { "session-a1b2c3": 75, "session-d4e5f6": 50 }
}
```

#### `game_over`
Match ended - someone won (fires when any zombie's x reaches ≤ 0; no wave/duration tracking yet).
```json
{
  "winnerId": "session-a1b2c3",
  "reason": "opponent_lawn_breached"
}
```

**`plant_placed`, `opponent_disconnected`, `connection_restored`, and `action_rejected` are documented design intent but not implemented — see NETWORKING_CONTRACT_REVISED.md for the full gap list.**

## UI/UX Review (Live Frontend)

Verified live at https://pvz-frontend.vercel.app/ via browser screenshot
(default lobby view and `?demo=1` game view). Confirms and extends the
code-based predictions from the earlier pass.

### Confirmed bugs (seen live, not just in code)

1. **Overlapping text in the HUD.** The multi-line status block
   ("Tick / Room / Player / Sun / mode", 5 lines) is drawn at a fixed
   position, and the hint text ("Click anywhere to request a peashooter
   placement.") is drawn 26px below the *start* of that block instead of
   below its end — the two literally overlap and are unreadable where they
   cross ("Room:" and "...where to request a peashooter placement." sit on
   the same line). Fix: compute the hint's y-position from the status
   block's actual rendered height, or move the hint to a fixed corner.

2. **Entities render outside the visible lane — a real coordinate-system
   bug, not just styling.** The lane background is drawn relative to the
   *current* canvas height (`height * 0.5`), which stretches to fill the
   window since the canvas uses `Phaser.Scale.RESIZE`. But entity positions
   (from `demoState` and from the backend's `state_update`) are fixed
   absolute pixels like `y: 180`, assuming a small fixed-size board. On a
   normal laptop window, the lane renders around the vertical middle of the
   screen while all plants/zombies render up near the top — completely
   detached from the lane they're supposedly standing in. I confirmed this
   by clicking to place a new plant: the new plant appeared exactly at the
   click position (inside the lane, using pointer coordinates), while the
   three original demo entities stayed stuck near the top-left, nowhere
   near the lane. **This will look broken in every real game, not just
   demo mode**, since the backend sends the same kind of fixed pixel
   coordinates. Needs a proper coordinate system (e.g., a fixed logical
   game resolution like 800×400 scaled/letterboxed into the viewport,
   rather than absolute pixels matched against a resized canvas).

3. **Low-contrast header text.** "Demo mode • Player ..." and "Status: ..."
   render in a dark gray-blue on the purple/blue gradient background —
   confirmed hard to read at a glance, consistent with the "`App.css` styles
   nothing that exists" finding below.

### Confirmed issues (found in code, consistent with what's on screen)

4. **`App.css` is stale and styles nothing that exists.** It defines rules
   for `.container`, `.status`, `.links`, `.next-steps` — leftover from an
   earlier placeholder landing page. The actual JSX in `App.tsx` uses
   `.app-shell`, `.app-header`, `.game-canvas`, none of which have any CSS
   rules — which is exactly why the header renders as plain unstyled text.

5. **Global body styling fights the full-screen game canvas.** `global.css`
   sets `body` to a purple gradient with
   `display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center` — styling
   meant for a centered marketing card, not a full-viewport game. Combined
   with bug #2 above, this compounds the "nothing lines up" feeling.

6. **No visual distinction between demo mode and live mode beyond a text
   string** buried in the same small HUD block that's already overlapping
   (bug #1).

7. **No loading/connecting state beyond plain text.** "Connecting..." is
   just a text string with no spinner — on Render's free tier the backend
   can take 30+ seconds to wake from a cold start, and a bare text line is
   easy to mistake for the app being broken.

8. **No error state for connection failure**, and **no sun-cost/afford-
   ability feedback** before placement, and **no room-code sharing UI**
   (starting a match currently requires manually constructing a `?room=`
   URL) — all still true as originally noted.

### Fixed in this pass (July 12, 2026)

The three highest-priority items above have been implemented in the frontend
source (not yet deployed — needs `git push` + Vercel redeploy to go live):

- **Coordinate system:** added `GAME_WIDTH`/`GAME_HEIGHT` (800×400) constants
  matching the values already documented in `NETWORKING_CONTRACT_REVISED.md`,
  and switched the Phaser scale mode from `RESIZE` to `FIT` with
  `autoCenter: CENTER_BOTH` (`frontend/src/App.tsx`). Entity coordinates from
  the backend now land inside the lane at any window size instead of floating
  near the top-left.
- **HUD overlap:** removed the canvas-drawn `staticText`/`hintText` from
  `GameScene.js` entirely; the scene now emits a `hud-update` event that
  `App.tsx` listens to and renders as a real HTML/CSS overlay
  (`.hud-overlay`, `.hud-hint`, `.mode-badge`), so status text can't collide
  anymore.
- **Stale CSS / body-canvas conflict:** rewrote `App.css` (removed the
  leftover landing-page rules, added real styles for `.app-shell`,
  `.app-header`, `.game-stage`, `.game-canvas`) and removed the body-level
  flex-centering in `global.css` that was fighting the game canvas.

Not yet done: lobby/connection states (spinner, cold-start message, retry),
room-code sharing UI, sun-cost/affordability feedback, and rejected-placement
toasts — still tracked as Phases 3–4 above.

**Note on verification:** I couldn't run a full `npm run build` in this
session — `npm install` repeatedly timed out in the sandbox (network/proxy
issue, not a code issue). I verified correctness by hand: read every changed
file back, confirmed brace/bracket balance, and ran `node --check` on the
plain-JS files. I also caught and fixed a real bug in the process — two of
the edited files (`App.css`, `GameScene.js`) ended up with stray trailing
null bytes after in-place edits shrank them below their original size (a
quirk of this sandbox's file mount, not a code logic issue); both were
cleaned up and re-verified. Recommend running `npm run build` locally or
letting Vercel's build step catch anything before merging.

### Suggested improvements, roughly in priority order

1. Fix the coordinate system (#2) — this is the highest-impact bug since it
   makes the actual game look broken, not just the lobby screen.
2. Fix HUD text overlap (#1) and move status/hint text out of Phaser canvas
   text into a proper HTML/CSS overlay (styled, positioned independent of
   canvas redraws).
3. Replace `App.css`'s leftover landing-page styles with real rules for
   `.app-shell` / `.app-header` / `.game-canvas`, and stop the body from
   flex-centering a full-viewport canvas.
4. Add a "Creating room..." / "Waiting for opponent..." screen with a
   spinner and copyable invite link, replacing the current bare-text lobby
   message.
5. Add a visible sun-cost badge before placement and a rejected-placement
   flash/toast once the backend supports `action_rejected`.
6. Add a connection-timeout message acknowledging Render free-tier cold
   starts, and a real error state if the socket never connects.
7. Give demo vs. live mode a clear visual treatment (banner/badge) instead
   of burying it in overlapping status text.

## Summary for Your Friend

**Hi! Welcome to the project.** 👋

Update: the frontend scaffolding this section used to assign as "your job" is
already done — LobbyScene, GameScene, Socket.io wiring, and a live Vercel
deployment all exist. What's actually left is game-logic depth and reliability
work, split between backend and frontend.

**What's already done:**
- Backend live and tested (in-memory only, no persistence yet)
- Frontend built and deployed: lobby, game rendering, click-to-place, demo mode
- Real-time sync working end-to-end against the live backend

**What's next (see "Next Steps" above for the full breakdown):**
1. Zombie waves + plant/zombie combat (currently: one zombie, no combat)
2. Plant type selection (currently: peashooter only)
3. Reconnect grace period + disconnect messaging (currently: none)
4. Wire up Supabase or drop it from the stack
5. UI/UX polish pass (see UI/UX Review section)

The networking contract (NETWORKING_CONTRACT_REVISED.md) has been corrected to
describe what's actually implemented, not the original aspirational design —
read it before adding new socket events so you don't build against events that
don't exist.

**Let's ship! 🚀**
